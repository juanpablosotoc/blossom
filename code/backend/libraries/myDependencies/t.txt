        <Audio title="Classical mechanics">
        Classical mechanics is the branch of physics that describes the motion of macroscopic objects under forces, using concepts of space, time and mass. It applies when speeds are much less than the speed of light and when quantum effects are negligible. It provides a deterministic framework: given initial conditions and forces, the future motion is (in principle) fully determined.

                            A force is conservative if the work it does on a particle moving between two points is independent of the path taken. In other words, the work done by the force around any closed path is zero. Examples include gravitational force and electrostatic force.

                            Translational symmetry means that the laws of physics do not change if a system is shifted (translated) in space. In other words, the physical properties and behavior of a system remain the same regardless of its position in space.

                            Rotational symmetry means that the laws of physics remain unchanged when a system is rotated about a particular axis. In other words, the physical properties and behavior of a system are invariant under rotations.
