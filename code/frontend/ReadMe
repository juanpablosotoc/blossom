You will find there are two frontends:

	- The actual browser is in desktop_app
	- The frontend where people go to download the browser is in web_app.

Both use very similar tsx components, along with similar technologies.
Both are made with React, Typescript, SASS and Vite.

The Browser also used Electron for the creation of the desktop application.
