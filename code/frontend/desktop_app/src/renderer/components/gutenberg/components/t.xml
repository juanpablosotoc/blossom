<>        <Audio title="Introduction">        Economics is the study of how individuals, firms, governments, and societies choose to use scarce resources to satisfy competing wants. It explains how people make choices, how those choices interact in markets and institutions, and what outcomes (prices, production, income, growth) result.        </Audio>        <br />        <h3>Core idea</h3>        <br />        <ul>            <li>                <h4>Scarcity and choice</h4>                <p>Resources (time, labor, capital, land) are limited; deciding how to allocate them requires trade-offs.</p>            </li>            <li>                <h4>Opportunity cost</h4>                <p>The true cost of something is what you give up to get it (the next-best alternative).</p>            </li>            <li>                <h4>Incentives matter</h4>                <p>People respond to rewards and penalties; changing incentives changes behavior.</p>            </li>        </ul>        <br />        <h3>Two main branches</h3>        <br />        <ul>            <li>                <h4>Microeconomics</h4>                <p>Behavior of individual agents — consumers, firms, workers; topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, consumer choice, production, pricing, market structures (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly), and market failures.</p>                <InfoLink title="Introduction to Microeconomics" prompt="Explain microeconomics in depth including its fundamental principles, key concepts like supply and demand, market structures, and the role of government intervention, as well as how it differs from macroeconomics."></InfoLink>            </li>            <li>                <h4>Macroeconomics</h4>                <p>Economy-wide phenomena — GDP, inflation, unemployment, economic growth, business cycles, monetary and fiscal policy, and international trade.</p>                <InfoLink title="Introduction to Macroeconomics" prompt="Explain macroeconomics in depth, including its fundamental concepts such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, fiscal and monetary policy, and how it differs from microeconomics in its focus on the overall economy."></InfoLink>            </li>        </ul>        <br />        <h3>Key concepts and mechanisms</h3>        <br />        <BigUl>            <BigLi title="Supply and demand">                <Audio>                Prices coordinate decisions of buyers and sellers; equilibrium price quantity clears the market.                </Audio>                <InfoLink title="Understanding Supply and Demand in Economics" prompt="Explain the concepts of supply and demand in economics in depth, including how they interact to determine prices, the factors that influence each, and the effects of shifts in supply and demand on market equilibrium."></InfoLink>            </BigLi>            <BigLi title="Marginal analysis">                <Audio>                Decisions are made at the margin (e.g., consume one more unit if marginal benefit > marginal cost).                </Audio>                <InfoLink title="Marginal Analysis in Economics" prompt="Explain marginal analysis in economics in depth, including its importance in decision-making, how it involves comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs, and its applications in various economic scenarios."></InfoLink>            </BigLi>            <BigLi title="Elasticity">                <Audio>                How much quantity demanded or supplied responds to price or income changes.                </Audio>                <InfoLink title="Elasticity in Economics: Concepts and Applications" prompt="Explain elasticity in economics in depth, including the different types such as price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, and income elasticity, as well as how elasticity affects consumer behavior and market outcomes."></InfoLink>            </BigLi>            <BigLi title="Comparative advantage and gains from trade">                <Audio>                Entities specialize where they have lower opportunity cost and trade for mutual benefit.                </Audio>                <InfoLink title="Comparative Advantage and Gains from Trade" prompt="Explain the concept of comparative advantage and how it leads to gains from trade in depth, including the underlying principles, how it differs from absolute advantage, and its implications for individuals, businesses, and countries engaging in trade."></InfoLink>            </BigLi>            <BigLi title="Market failures">                <SpeedReader>                Situations where markets fail to allocate efficiently — public goods, externalities (pollution), information asymmetry, and monopoly power.
