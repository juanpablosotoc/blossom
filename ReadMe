It integrates a fine-tuned OpenAI model that writes in a custom markup language called Gutenberg, designed to generate deeply visual and interactive explanations for students.

💻 Installation (macOS DMG)

If you downloaded the Blossom Browser from the official site, macOS may prevent it from opening because it’s unsigned.
To run it safely:

1️⃣ Remove quarantine from the DMG

xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/blossom_arm64.dmg

2️⃣ Mount the DMG

hdiutil attach /path/to/blossom_arm64.dmg

3️⃣ Open the mounted volume

Drag Blossom.app into your Applications folder.

4️⃣ Remove quarantine from the installed app

xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/"Blossom.app"

If you still get a warning, right-click → Open once; macOS will then trust the app.
